## Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python

### Overview
This project analyzes the unemployment rate, especially the spike during COVID-19, using Python. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the dataset.

### Project Structure
- **`unemployment_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- **`dataset/unemployment.csv`**: The dataset used for analysis.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.
