## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

### Overview
This project involves classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their measurements. The objective is to train a machine learning model using the Iris dataset to accurately predict the species of a flower given its measurements.

### Project Structure
- **`iris_classification.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **`dataset/iris.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the relationships between features and classes.
3. **Model Training**: Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Decision Trees.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and model performance.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

### Results
Include the final accuracy and insights on how well the model performed.
