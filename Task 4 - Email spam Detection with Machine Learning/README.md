## Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

### Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam. The model uses features extracted from the email content to make predictions.

### Project Structure
- **`spam_detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- **`dataset/spam.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

### Dataset
The dataset includes labeled emails with the following features:
- Email Content
- Label (Spam/Non-Spam)

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the email content, tokenize text, and remove stop words.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use techniques like TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Train models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Conclusion**: Discuss the effectiveness of the model and its ability to detect spam.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NLTK

### Results
Summarize the modelâ€™s accuracy and its ability to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.
