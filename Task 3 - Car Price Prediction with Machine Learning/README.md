## Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting the price of a car based on various factors such as brand, features, horsepower, and mileage. The objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts car prices.

### Project Structure
- **`car_price_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **`dataset/car_prices.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information on car prices along with attributes like:
- Car Brand
- Model
- Year of Manufacture
- Engine Size
- Mileage
- Features

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, encode categorical features, and handle missing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze correlations between features and car prices.
3. **Model Training**: Train models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
5. **Conclusion**: Discuss the modelâ€™s accuracy and the most influential factors on car prices.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

### Results
Present the final model performance and key factors affecting car prices.
