## Task 5: Sales Prediction Using Python

### Overview
The objective of this project is to predict future sales based on factors like advertising spend, target audience, and platform. The aim is to provide insights that can guide marketing strategies.

### Project Structure
- **`sales_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- **`dataset/sales.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

### Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales data with features such as:
- Advertising Spend
- Platform
- Target Audience
- Product Category

### Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends and correlations in the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Time Series forecasting.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
5. **Conclusion**: Discuss the modelâ€™s accuracy and potential business impact.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

### Results
Present the final predictions and insights on factors driving sales.
